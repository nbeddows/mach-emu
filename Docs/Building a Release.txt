2. Make sure Cppcheck is installed and is in your environment path.

3. Make sure you are on the development branch and everything required for the release is committed to it.

4. Increment the major/minor/bugfix version numbers in the Sdk CMakeLists.txt and the Docs Doxyfile according to the scope of the release.

5. Commit and push the Sdk and Doxyfile changes.

	git commit -m "Updated the Sdk version number" Sdk/CMakeLists.txt Docs/Doxyfile
	git push

6. Make sure the Changelog is up to date (including the version number!).

7. Commit and push the Changelog.

	git commit -m "Updated for version v<major>.<minor>.<patch>" Changelog.txt
	git push

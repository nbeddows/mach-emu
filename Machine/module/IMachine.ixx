							interrupt.
							
							A valid reason for having a null io controller would be if you
							wanted to run a machine for a certain period of time.

							For example;

							...
							...

							memoryController_.Load ("myProgram.bin");
							machine_.SetMemoryController (memoryController_);

							...
							...
							
							auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, [&]
							{

							auto status = future.wait_for(seconds(2));

							//One can check that status of the machine and
							//memory after 2 seconds of run time.

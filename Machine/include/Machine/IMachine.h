		// Load memory with program via custom controller method
		customMemoryController->LoadProgram("myProgram.com");

		// Create custom IO Controller (See tests for examples)

		// Set the memory and IO controllers with the machine
		machine->SetIOController(customIOController);
		machine->SetMemoryController(customMemoryController);

		// Run the machine
		machine->Run();

		// controller ServiceInterrupts override generates an ISR::Quit interrupt.

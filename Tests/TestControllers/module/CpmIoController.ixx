	A basic io controller which emulates 8 bit CP/M BDOS
	console output and output string system calls.

	@discussion		This io controller is used for running the cpudiag tests
					which were originally written targeting CP/M BDOS.
					BDOS calls start from 0x0005 and since we aren't running
					CP/M we can't call 0x0005 to make those system calls, so
					the cpudiag tests program was modified to perform the
					BDOS call through a custom IO, hence eliminating the
					dependence on CP/M BDOS. See cpudiag_readme.txt for
					more information.
